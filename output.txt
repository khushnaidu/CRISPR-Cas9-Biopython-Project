The metrics list we used to make this score were: 

-The counting of the Ts and Cs adjacent to the PAM site(Because the nucleotides adjacent to the PAM site contain significantly lower counts of Cs and Ts
-A measure of higher GC content in the whole sequence(Functional gRNAs show lower counts of GC content

Low Goodness Score = Good Quality gRNA
