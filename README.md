# CRISPR-Cas9-Biopython-Project
gRNA designing and rating tool for CRISPR-Cas9

# To run the program

Please have a virutalenv set up that uses the requirements.txt dependicies included in this repo

1. Launch your virutalenv

2. Run pip3 install -r requirements 

3. Then to run the program, python3 main.py


# Sections of program'

Our first option of our program takes in genome sequence(s) and pulls gRNA out of it and rates each gRNA sequence bsaed ona goodness score.

Second option of our program is pulling out gRNA sequences of a given genomes(s) and then checking for a given target sequence that
is configurable in the config.json
